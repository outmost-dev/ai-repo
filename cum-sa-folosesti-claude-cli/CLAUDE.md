# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is an educational repository focused on teaching users how to effectively use Claude Code CLI. It contains Romanian-language documentation about:
- Best practices for using Claude Code CLI in programming and business contexts
- Advanced prompting techniques for AI interactions

## Content Structure

The repository contains two main documentation files:

### how-tolearn-ai.md
Educational guide with 10 best practices for using Claude Code CLI, split into:
- **Programming practices (1-5)**: Code exploration with agents, todo list management, code reviews, refactoring, debugging
- **Business organization practices (6-10)**: Process automation, custom tools, documentation generation, data analysis, system integrations

### how-to-prompting.md
Comprehensive prompting guide covering:
- **Fundamental principles**: Specificity, context, format specification
- **Advanced techniques**: Chain of Thought, Few-Shot Prompting, Role Prompting, Iterative Refinement
- **Task-specific templates**: Programming, debugging, data analysis, code optimization
- **Common mistakes**: Vague prompting, missing context, implicit assumptions
- **Advanced strategies**: Divide and conquer, constraints, progressive disclosure
- **Ready-to-use templates**: Code review, refactoring, learning concepts

## Language and Audience

- **Primary language**: Romanian
- **Target audience**: Romanian-speaking developers and business owners learning to use AI tools
- **Content style**: Educational, practical, example-driven

## Working with This Repository

When adding or modifying content:
- Maintain Romanian language throughout all documentation
- Use practical, concrete examples that illustrate concepts clearly
- Follow the established structure: principle → example → benefits
- Include both bad (❌) and good (✅) examples where applicable
- Keep a conversational yet professional tone suitable for educational content
- Reference official Claude Code documentation where relevant

## Content Guidelines

- Examples should be realistic and immediately applicable
- Use clear formatting: headers, bullet points, code blocks, checklists
- Include templates that users can copy and adapt
- Emphasize the "why" behind each practice, not just the "how"
- Link to external resources (Claude Code docs, prompt engineering guides) when appropriate
